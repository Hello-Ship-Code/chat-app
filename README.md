## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/orbitchat.git
   cd orbitchat
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies for Each Service:**

   For the **Messaging Microservice**:
   ```bash
   cd services/messaging

   - Similarly, set up environment variables for the web and mobile parts.

4. **Run the Application:**

   - **Start Backend Microservices:**  
     Launch each service (consider using Docker Compose or a process manager like PM2 for multi-service orchestration)
     ```bash
     npm start  # Run in each service folder, or use your orchestration setup
     ```
   - **Web Frontend:**  
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - **Mobile App:**  
     Run on your simulator/device using:
     ```bash
     npx react-native run-ios   # or npx react-native run-android
     ```
